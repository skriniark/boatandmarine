<h4>Qualifications and Training Requirements </h4><br><p>Aircraft cleaning jobs come with (qualifications and training requirements)! It's not as simple as just showing up and wiping down a plane. In order to be able to work in this field, one must meet certain criteria. Firstly, they need to have a high school diploma or equivalent. Secondly, they must be capable of lifting heavy objects and perform basic maintenance tasks.
